  % \lettersection{About Me}
  The quality of the instruction was not great. The lectures were okay. They consisted of the professor going over the slides and explaining them, meanwhile the lecture TA Eric Munson answered questions (he was pretty good). The lectures were poorly organized, jumping from topic to topic then back to previous topics in a strange order. Sometimes they were big dumps of information, and it was hard to tell what was and wasn't important. The lectures also had exercises related to the material that we usually completed during the lecture intermission or after the lecture. Their content was generally not too bad, and helped solidify my understanding. However, sometimes it was quite annoying to have to redo quizzes because I needed to match typos in the quiz that the instructor included out of carelessness. This was at its worst when at the beginning of the course, we were required to write our code answers into a Quercus quiz. This is absurd, as code can be written very differently so that it does the same thing. Furthermore, the "correct" answers were sometimes strange and unreasonable. This is annoying as PCRS exists for this very reason. The tutorials were not great. Sometimes they were a vague overview of upcoming assignments, which was useless to me as it's not very enlightening to watch someone scroll through a big folder of code. Other times, they were overviews of specific examples of the concepts from class, which were not engaging at all. They were mostly useless if we did not already understand the material from the lecture. We also had tutorial exercises for many weeks, which were generally not too bad, except when they were Quercus quizzes. The assignments were by far the worst part of this course. Oooooh boy. Assignment 1a was a design proposal for our file system, to be implemented for A1b.
